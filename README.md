# Programming for Data Anaysis  Assignment 1
Repository for Programming for Data Anaysis Assignment 1, Winter 2023


## Contents

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a data simulation project completed for the Programming for Data Analytics Module undertaken as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at ATU, Galway.


## Project Plan


>Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. Rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.

- At least 100 data points required
- At least 4 variables
- Synthesise a data set as closely matching the properties as found in research as possible
- Use a Jupyter notebook - use images, links, code etc
- Research likely relationships between variables, their distributions and relationships/ correlation with each other
- Simulate data by devising an algorithm.
- Show research

The phenomenon I have chosen is based on ACL injuries in sport, particularly in female athletes.

## Running the Notebook

The Jupyter notebook PfDA Assignment.ipynb can be ran in any code editor such as Visual Studio Code, or using the web application JupyterLab.

The notebook contains all details in relation to the project including all references to research performed as part of the project.
