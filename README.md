## Contents

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a data simulation project completed for the Programming for Data Analytics Module undertaken as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics at ATU, Galway.


## Project Plan

Plan for the Project:

Simulate data of a phenomenon:

    injuries in women's football

- at least 100 data points required
- 4 variables:
    e.g. age, trianing hours in week, kms covered in week, occupation (if not professional), previous injury, menstrual cycle

Use a Jupyter notebook - use images, links, code etc

Research likely relationships between variables, their distributions and relationships/ correlation with each other

Simulate data by devising an algorithm.

Show research
